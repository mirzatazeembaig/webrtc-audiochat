# webrtc-audiochat
In this chapter, we are going to build a client application that allows two users on separate devices to communicate using WebRTC audio streams. Our application will have two pages. One for login and the other for making an audio call to another user.
You can then make an audio call to the tab and hang up the call.Run this source code in local host by downloading "Web Server for chrome" from Google Chrome Extensions and now Enjoy the voice call Facility.
